# Rotavirus Outbreak Detection Model

This is an early detection model for Rotavirus. It retrieves hidden data from data-sets and compares
the values with trained data-sets.

It is aimed at predicting a Rota-virus outbreak and thus assist healthcare practitioners to make intelligent clinical decisions which traditional decision support systems can not.

The detection is based on historical data from previous years trained to trigger an alert when reported or death cases exceed a certain seasonal limit.

## Demo

A Scatter Graph showing 'Death Cases' ploted against 'Reported Cases' of Rotavirus in 2019 for both male and female.

A Bar Graph showing 'Months' ploted against 'All Cases' of Rotavirus in 2018 for both male and female.

A Distribution Graph showing 'Density' ploted against 'Reported Cases' of Rotavirus in 2019 for both male and female.
