# Rotavirus Outbreak Prediction Model

This is an Outbreak Prediction Model for Rotavirus. It retrieves hidden data from data-sets and compares
the values with trained data-sets.

It is aimed at predicting a Rota-virus outbreak and thus assist healthcare practitioners to make intelligent clinical decisions which traditional decision support systems can not.

## Demo

A Scatter Graph showing 'Death Cases' ploted against 'Reported Cases' of Rotavirus in 2019 for both male and female.

A Bar Graph showing 'Months' ploted against 'All Cases' of Rotavirus in 2018 for both male and female.

A Distribution Graph showing 'Density' ploted against 'Reported Cases' of Rotavirus in 2019 for both male and female.
